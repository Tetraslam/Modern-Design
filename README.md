### What is this repo?

I've always wanted to learn how to make desktop applications. Well, I'm finally learning how to make them using C#, .NET and WPF!

At the end, this'll be an application which will keep you updated about all my latest projects right from the application.


### Planned features

- A fully integrated blog which will spit out articles written by yours truly ðŸ˜„
- A simple way to keep track of my latest projects and contribute or download them ðŸ’»
- Some minigames hopefully ðŸŽ®


### Installation

Installation is super easy! Just head on over to [releases](https://github.com/Tetraslam/Modern-Design/releases/tag/1.0) and download the latest version. As of the last time I updated this README, only the homepage is close to completion. But if you're interested in just looking at the cool design, go ahead and download the executable (Modern.Design.exe)!

Once it downloads, your web browser will probably mark the file as unsafe. When does it not? ðŸ™„ Go ahead and keep the file, and run it. Currently, version are **only available for Windows**, so I am sorry if you are on a Linux or MacOS machine.
